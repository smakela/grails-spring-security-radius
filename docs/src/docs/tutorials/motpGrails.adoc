=== MOTP and Grails application

All you need to do is install "grails-spring.security-radius" -plugin and
do a minimum configuration to  _grails-app/conf/Config.groovy_.

After that you can start authenticate with one-time passwords.

Please make sure your mobile client's and MOTP server's clocks are synchronized!
