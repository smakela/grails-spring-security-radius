==== MOTP Server

In this tutorial we are using Mobile-OTP Authentication Server (MOTP-AS) as our server.

It's full blown RADIUS server specifically for Mobile-OTP. Features include:

* Authenticating users by RADIUS (and optionally PAM or Apache)
* SQL database for user/device configuration
* Administration Web Interface (for admins and users)

You can download it from http://motp-as.network-cube.de/index.php/download/current-version[here]

I strongly recommend virtual image as it's a no-brainer to import to your favorite virtualization environment.
