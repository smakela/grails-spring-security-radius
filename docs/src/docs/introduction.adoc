== Introduction
Remote Authentication Dial In User Service (RADIUS) is a networking protocol that provides centralized Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) management for computers to connect and use a network service.

This plugin serves two of these functions:

    * to authenticate users
    * to authorize users
        ** Note: Authorization uses Grails application's database, because there is no standard attribute for roles in RADIUS.
